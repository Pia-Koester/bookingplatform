Admin Update
Admins can update activity details by sending a PUT request to `/api/activities/admin/:activity_id` with the updated activity details.

### Membership Plans

The naming of membership Plans might be a little bit confusing. What these mean is something which in german we would call 10er Karte. You have a set amount of times you can attend classes during a specific time frame. These memberships make it cheaper to attend compared to paying single price each time.

```json
{
  "title": "10-Class Pass",

}
```
